## Status

âœ… Accepted

## Context

Due to the relatively small size of the application, the state management needs are straightforward. Sharing state among components efficiently is essential.

## Decision

We will use React Context along with custom hooks as needed to manage and share state between components.

## Consequences

This solution keeps state management simple and aligned with the project scope. Should the application grow in complexity, we may need to reevaluate this approach.
