**Created:** 2025-02-27  
**Updated:** 2025-02-27  

## Status
✅ Accepted

## Context
Maintaining high code quality is crucial. The team prefers using React Testing Library for component testing and plans to use MSW for API mocking as recommended by SWR.

## Decision
- **Testing tools:** Use React Testing Library for component tests.
- **Mocking strategy:** Initially, mock domain hooks to provide the required data. This approach will be reviewed for potential integration of MSW in future iterations.

## Consequences
This strategy allows for rapid development and testing while ensuring reliable test outcomes. The chosen approach may be revisited to incorporate more robust endpoint mocking as the project evolves.
