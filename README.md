## Architectural Decision Records (ADR)

### What is an ADR?

An **Architectural Decision Record (ADR)** is a structured document that captures important architectural decisions, along with their context and consequences. This helps maintain clarity in project evolution.

### ADRs in This Project

This project follows ADRs to document major technical choices. Key decisions include:

1. **Choosing Vite over CRA** - Vite provides better performance and a modern development experience.
2. **Using Storybook for UI Component Development** - Enables isolated component development and documentation.
3. **Using React Testing Library + Vitest** - Ensures reliable UI behavior with fast and lightweight testing.

ADRs are stored in a `docs/adr/` directory for reference.
